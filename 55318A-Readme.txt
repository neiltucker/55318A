*****   Class Delivery   ***** 
55318A is the updated version of the retired legacy MOC course 10962C.  
This three-day course teaches students how to automate administrative tasks using PowerShell. 
Students will learn crucial scripting skills such as creating advanced functions, writing controller scripts, and handling script errors. 
Candidates will learn how to work with Microsoft Azure, Windows PowerShell Workflow, .NET resources, the REST API and XML and JSON formatted data files.  
By using demonstrations and hands-on labs, attendees will learn to perform these tasks using PowerShell tools on the desktop and on Internet cloud platforms.

The training center or any organization hosting the lab computers for this class are fully responsible for the licensing of all software used in the course and labs. 
An Azure deployment of the class may make this process easier.
